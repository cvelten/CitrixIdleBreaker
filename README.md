# IdleBreaker
This tool is a background process checking for Citrix "idle timeout" windows, which will be activated and "clicked away", stopping the timeout.
A second feature is the automatic random movement of the mouse curser to prevent screensavers from activating. This is not activated by default.

This only works while the user is logged in and the terminal is not locked.

I assume no warranty or liability for the performance of the code / program or any issues that might arise from its usage.
